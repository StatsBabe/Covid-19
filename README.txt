The research area of this study is Covid-19 data from John Hopkins University, from 22 January 2020 - 27 July 2020.
The efficacy of Linear Regression is evaluated on the data, specifically using confirmed cases to predict fatalities and recoveries.
 
Aims: 
1. Track the number of confirmed, recovered and deaths in every country globally, 
   work out top 15 as of 27 July 2020, do basic visualisations
2. Look at correlations between these variables (lat and long preserved as a sanity check)
3. Linear regression model 1: confirmed:fatalities, scatterplot and predicted values
4. Linear regression model 2: confirmed:recovered, scatterplot and predicted values
5. Evaluate both these models (R2, MAE, MSE), suggesting future non-linear/more sophisticated models to better understand this unpredictable virus.

Acknowledgements: many thanks to everyone associated with Code in Place/CS106A at Stanford University, the most awesome course. During the Covid-19 crisis,
Stanford generously opened its doors to give everyone a chance to study with them online, and I will always be grateful for converting me to a Pythonista.
Many thanks to the many Githubers, Kagglers and Youtubers who have provided me with so much guidance and inspiration.

Finally, many thanks to the Coursera course on Contact Tracing the Coronovirus (run by John Hopkins University) which I took and passed (96%)
